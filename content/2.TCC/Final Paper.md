## **About the Thesis**

### **Overview**

This thesis explores the rapidly growing sector of esports, which encompasses organized video game competitions where individuals and teams compete in various game genres such as real-time strategy (RTS), first-person shooters (FPS), fighting games, multiplayer online battle arenas (MOBA), and battle royale games. Reflecting the structure of traditional sports, esports involves leagues, tournaments, and professional teams. The global esports market, valued at $1.72 billion in 2023, is projected to grow to $9.29 billion by 2032, driven by increasing investments, audience growth, and demand for tournament infrastructure.

### **The Problem**

Despite the exponential growth and popularity of esports, particularly highlighted by a 20% increase in viewership in Brazil during the pandemic, the industry faces significant challenges in information dissemination. The diverse array of teams and games leads to fragmented information, with each entity managing its own communication channels. This fragmentation makes it difficult for fans to follow updates and access comprehensive information about esports events and developments.

### **The Proposed Solution**

The thesis proposes the development of a centralized platform for esports content. This platform aims to serve as a comprehensive aggregator of news, results, statistics, and interviews, while also hosting a forum for community discussions. It will address the information fragmentation by providing a unified point of access for all things esports, including game updates, team news, and tournament schedules. The platform will allow users to personalize their experience, receive notifications about their favorite games, and participate in community-driven competitions and discussions.

### **Unique Value Proposition**

The proposed platform distinguishes itself by offering extensive coverage across various games, teams, and championships. It is designed to enhance user engagement through customizable content delivery, an integrated forum, and market research functionalities. The platform's inclusive community approach and emphasis on user interaction through forums and internal championships will further strengthen its position as a central hub for esports enthusiasts.

### **Revenue Model**

The platform will generate revenue through targeted advertising and a subscription model. It will offer exclusive content, including in-depth analyses, interviews with experts, and live event streaming, adding significant value for subscribers and enhancing the overall user experience.
